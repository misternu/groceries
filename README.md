# Rails Groceries List App (sans jQuery)

Rails has dropped jQuery as a dependency. I was curious about any differences in ujs without it, so I made this simple rails to-do list app, adding no gems or non-vanilla JavaScript.

```
bundle
bundle exec rails db:create
bundle exec rails db:migrate
bundle exec rails s
open http://localhost:3000
```
